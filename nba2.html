        <h1>NBA scores, highlights: LeBron leads surging Lakers past Jazz; Warriors snap four-game losing streak</h1>
        <img src="img/nba.png" id="nba">
        <p>The NBA had the day off on Thanksgiving but returned with a massive 14-game slate on Friday. The Minnesota Timberwolves got the action started with a win over the Brooklyn Nets. After that, the Celtics managed to snap out of their funk in a dominant victory over the Hawks while the Knicks went on and stunned the Pelicans. 

                The West Coast games were among the most interesting because of the slide that the Golden State Warriors had been on in recent weeks. The Warriors are currently without superstar Stephen Curry as he continues to work his way back from a groin injury. In addition, Draymond Green has also been dealing with a toe injury that kept him out on Friday as well, but Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant led the way as the Warriors put an end to their four-game losing streak.
                
                Here's everything you need to know about Friday's action, and a look at Saturday's schedule.</p>
                <h1>Crawford wins it for Suns</h1>
                <p>The Suns have been one of the worst teams in the NBA, and the Bucks have been one of the best -- guess this is why they play the games.
                     Jamal Crawford sealed the Phoenix upset with a game-winning jumper with less than a second remaining in the fourth quarter.</p>
                     <h1>Dame dunks in traffic</h1>
                     <p>
                            You don't often see point guards explode in traffic for dunks like this, but that's part of what makes Damian Lillard such a special player.

                     <h1>Mills beats the buzzer for the Spurs</h1>
                     <p>The San Antonio Spurs capped off the first quarter of their matchup with the Indiana Pacers in style as veteran guard Patty Mills beat the buzzer with a deep jumper from the perimeter. </p>

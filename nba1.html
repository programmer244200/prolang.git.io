        <h1>NBA scores, highlights: LeBron leads surging Lakers past Jazz; Warriors snap four-game losing streak</h1>
        <img src="img/nba.png" id="nba">
        <p>The NBA had the day off on Thanksgiving but returned with a massive 14-game slate on Friday. The Minnesota Timberwolves got the action started with a win over the Brooklyn Nets. After that, the Celtics managed to snap out of their funk in a dominant victory over the Hawks while the Knicks went on and stunned the Pelicans. 

                The West Coast games were among the most interesting because of the slide that the Golden State Warriors had been on in recent weeks. The Warriors are currently without superstar Stephen Curry as he continues to work his way back from a groin injury. In addition, Draymond Green has also been dealing with a toe injury that kept him out on Friday as well, but Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant led the way as the Warriors put an end to their four-game losing streak.
                
                Here's everything you need to know about Friday's action, and a look at Saturday's schedule.</p>
